Following a discussion from here https://doublegdp.slack.com/archives/CQLNFTC3F/p1616162661018800   

This project requires GITLAB_TOKEN="sometoken" in your environment variables

This has no extra dependencies and it only requires ruby to run
`ruby deploy.rb`

Todo: 
- Could be a CLI or a rake task
- Find better way of using environment variables
